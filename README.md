# Hitozemashi Pattern

This little programm takes one or two words as parameters and shows a plot of a hitmezashi stitch pattern generated from them.
If only one word is given it splits the word into two equal parts, making in more wide than high, if that's not possible.

_Inspiration for this comes from a Video by @ayliean on TikTok_
